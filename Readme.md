# webhooks-example

  An example server for receiving [Segment.io webhook requests](https://segment.io/docs/integrations/webhooks).


## Getting Started

  1. Clone the repository with `git clone git@github.com:segmentio/webhooks-example.git`.
  2. Download and install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/).
  3. Run `make` from the example directory to run the server on port `3000`.
  4. Enable webhooks for your project in [Segment.io](https://segment.io/). You'll want to enter your url in the form `http://YOUR_IP_ADDRESS:3000/webhooks/analytics`.

  ![Enter your webhooks URL.](https://s3.amazonaws.com/segmentio/github/images/webhooks-example/webhooks-sheet.png)

  You should see events start logging to your console as you call `analytics.track()`.


## Port Forwarding

  If you're using a router, it's likely that you'll need to enable port forwarding to receive calls from our servers. To do this, make sure you are pointing your router to your own internal IP on the same port.
